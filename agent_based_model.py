Assignment 4: Agent-Based Model for Structural Tessellation Generation

Author: Martin Forn√° 

Description:
This script implements an agent-based model using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
It simulates the behavior of agents to generate structural patterns, exploring how changes in
rules and parameters affect the resulting form.

The script explores attraction of agents to specified attractor points, as well as repulsing agents from each other
A small amount of randomness has been added to add a slight erraticness to their movement, so it is less detmerministic
The script has many parameters that can be adjusted to achive different results
Finally the script will create a Delaunay triangulated mesh from the final positions of the agents.

Note: This script is intended to be used within Grasshopper's Python scripting component.
Note: The script contains multiple codeblocks which are intended to run in their own Python scripting component. These have been marked accordingly.
